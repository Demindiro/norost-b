==========
Filesystem
==========

A filesystem needs to support ___ basic operations:

* Create
* Destroy
* Read
* Write
* List

To improve performance, some other operations are supported too:

* Open
* Close
* Terminate

A file will be referred to as an object, as the semantics described here are
not limited to filesystems.
