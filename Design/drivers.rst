Drivers
=======

Drivers are split in two categories:


Kernel drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are built directly into the kernel and have unlimited access to all
internals. These are generally put in the kernel out of performance or
practicality concerns.


User drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

These drivers are regular processes but they expose a filesystem.
