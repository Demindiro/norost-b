= Building the Rust toolchain

If you use a a Linux system, `make` should suffice.

If not, edit `config.toml` to use the appriopriate host.
For Linux this is `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
Check the appropriate target triple for your platform.

NOTE: `x.py dist` is broken due to a dependency on the `libc` crate, which isn't configured yet
for this target.
